# BioRPC
An RPC for dsc.bio, made in Node.

## Warning
Fair warning, it is __HIGHLY RECOMMENDED__ to NOT be used on any platform besides Windows. macOS/Linux versions do exist (check the ``other`` branch), but versions are behind.

## Disclaimer
Note that BioRPC is in __no way or form__ developed by or affiliated with discord.bio. I just created this project so I could have a clean Rich Presence that displays my dsc.bio link, and decided to share this on GitHub. If anyone would like to continue contributing to this project, feel free to submit a PR!
